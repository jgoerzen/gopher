gopher (3.0.4) unstable; urgency=low
  * MAJOR rewrite of regex support.  This should make gopher
    compile and work better on several platforms.
  * Added regcomp and regree func checks to configure.in and
    regenerated configure and config.h
  * Removed the DOMAIN configure support, DOMAIN_NAME in gopherd,
    backupdomain in Socket.c, etc.  This should prevent the no.domain.name
    problem that people have been seeing.  Regenerated configure stuff.
  * Added line for .png to gopherd.conf.in
  * Added note about UFS builds on MacOS X to doc/PLATFORMS
  * Added FAQ and modified debian/docs
  * Updated gopherd.8 with information about type 'i'
  * Fixed gopher's URL handling -- it was missing the type character.
    Closes: #138337.
  * Another regex change.  Let's hope this fixes things for Solaris.
  * Fixed to properly calculated first arg to select in gopherd.c

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Tue, 19 Mar 2002 13:08:39 -0500

gopher (3.0.3) unstable; urgency=low
  * Patches for FreeBSD:
    * Test in configure for stdlib.h
    * Include stdlib.h if it's available in Malloc.h
    * Don't include malloc.h if it's missing in Malloc.h
    * Don't include strcasestr if it's present in util.c and util.h
  * Actually use our configure.in test for malloc.h in object/* files.
  * New configure.in tests for regexp.h and libgen.h
  * Regex.c: define __GOPHER_REGEX_C__ for extern support in Regex.h
  * Regex.c: For __APPLE__, REGEX_param is regexp *.
  * Regex.h: Move the lengthy SYSV regex test to top of file
  * Regex.h: Wrap libgen.h include in HAVE_LIBGEN_H
  * Regex.h: Enclose REGEX_param=regcomp in parens to avoid warnings
  * Regex.h: Add extern for REGEX_param.
  * Regex.h: Darwin is unlike anything else.  Support it with
    __APPLE__.
  * STRstring.h: Include malloc.h only if actually here.
  * Ditto for Stdlib.h.
  * Added /etc/logrotate.d/gopherd to gopherd.conffiles.
    Closes: #132804.

 -- John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>  Tue, 12 Feb 2002 07:45:00 -0500

gopher (3.0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * gopher: Removed processing of . at end of text files.  It would stop
    downloading when it would see ".\n" in a file.  Will need to modify
    gopher/ourutils.c:937 area to deal with this properly -- ignore
    .\n if it's at the end of the file, otherwise preserve it.
    Reported by Ashok Aiyar <aiyar@ebv.mimnet.nwu.edu>
  * Did the modification as described above.
  * Updated README.
  * Global change gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu -> gopher@complete.org
  * Removed ./GPL.  This info is now in the file COPYING.
  * Changes to work with Solaris:
    * configure.in: Now looks for strings.h and string.h
    * object/Regex.h: Now include re_comp.h if available.
      Include regex.h only if re_comp.h is unavailable.
      Define the SYSVREGEX stuff only if HAVE_RE_COMP_H is not defined
    * object/String.h: Include string.h and strings.h based on configure
      test.
    Reports from Don Fike <fike@cs.utk.edu>
  * Added doc/PLATFORMS and updated debian/docs
  * gopherd.conf's include of gopherdlocal.conf was hardcoded to /etc.
    Now use configure's sysconfdir to generate it.  Moved gopherd.conf
    to gopherd.conf.in, modified Makefile.in to support this, removed
    gopherd.conf from source tree.  Reported by Kevin Griffin
    <vertov@artstar.com>
  * Added lines to gopherd.conf.in for .ogg and .mp2 files.
    Suggestion from Kevin Griffin <vertov@artstar.com>
  * Using $(INSTALL) from subdirectories broke on systems
    where install-sh was used because $(INSTALL) would always
    resolve to ./install-sh.  Replaced all instances of
    $(INSTALL) with @INSTALL@ (autoconf would provide the correct
    path) and removed INSTALL from Makefile.config.  Reported
    by Don Fike <fike@cs.utk.edu> on Solaris 2.6. 
  * Updated our copy of install-sh with the one from
    a current automake.
  * Updated patchlevel.h for release of 3.0.2.

    but not his patch.
    * gopher.c, gopherd/error.c, gopher/download.c:
      Modified to use HAVE_STRERROR
